# rock-paper-scissors

In this assignement I tried to take my coding journey a step further and really
devote to understanding every single bit of code I was writing. This resulted in me
spending approximately 3 days in the entirety of the code with comments.

For the most part, coding this project was very relaxing and eye-opening. As I'm venturing
deeper and deeper into my coding journey I started to wonder if git commits should be a reflexion
of the workflow or if workflow should be a reflection of the git commit philosophy. Certainly there's
some aspects of the project I could improve in the nearby future and my commit tree won't help
tracing back these aspects but at the same time the end result code is something that
came through this workflow. My conclusion is that only time will tell.

Long story short, this program is played through the console so no CSS/HTML. Rock Paper Scissors
game with custom rounds and some error-catching logic into it. Overall should be a solid interface.
I will probably come back to this later to play and see if there's any logical errors in it. Overall I'm
happy with both the result and the coding journey that brought me here.
